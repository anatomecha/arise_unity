IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Default MaxSize of textures has been set to 1024 x 1024
to improve speed when importing the asset. To increase
resolution to 2048 or 4096, select the textures in SpaceBox
HD/Textures project folders and change MaxSize to 2048 or
4096 then click Apply (hint: you can select multiple
textures using shift/control key.)
